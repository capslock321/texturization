texturizer
======================
This is a little project that I did with an hour's time.

It texturizes an image given a image and a texture to texturize it with.

There is not much to it, and I don't plan to expand it.

Sample output can be found in the texturizer/assets/out folder.

Usage
--------------------
All the code is in the texturize.py file.
There is only one function that is useful.

You can call the texturize function by importing it and calling: 

.. code-block:: python
    
    texturize(image_to_be_texturized, texture_to_texturize_with)

Example images can be found in the assets folder.
